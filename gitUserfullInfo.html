    <h1>Git Essential Data</h1>
<pre>

===> git init , we can make our directory(folder), initialized as a git project , means , git will track all my changes now.
by this we are saying our local project is now a git respository., we are making our local project as a git respository

==> Commit matlab snapshot lena(photo lena)
==> When we commit , we need to tell git , who is commiting , as we are commiting from our local, so we need to set our info like email.
we can do that by:-

git config --global user.name "Rajesh Singh" // yeh mera "name" config hogaya yaha pe.
git config --global user.email "rajkesh007@gmail.com" // this configured my email

==> I can see the above configuration in git by 
git config --list (It will show all the configuration)
OR, individual , we can write this
git config --global user.name OR git config user.name
git config --global user.email OR git config user.email

<h2>GIT - THREE STAGE ARCHITECTURE.</h2>
==>><h1>local operations</h1>
Working Directory                        StagingArea(git add)                             git directory(repository)(Very important)(.git)
                                Those files , i want to go in the                   git repo is a (.git, folder), we have one hidden folder,         
                                next commit.                                        we have our project in this.
                                Stage means , want to go in the next commit         (.git) folder will compress all my project and keep, 
                                if i dont want the file to go in commit             with him, and the responsibility of git ,according to 
                                , then dont put in staging area                     our command , will give, the proper version, and put in our
                                After Stage we can commit , measn we take the       working directly.
                                Snapshot, photo and freeze.



Will take snapshot of my folder , means , we will freeze the , exsiting look of my project and save., lets say that as V1(version), we will say 
it a commit. c1-working V1.

Important Command
git reset HEAD fileName  (this command will take teh respective file from stage area to working Directory , means , remove from the staging area)
git commit -m "message write" (this will create a snapshot, will take a photo of the files in commit or whatever in the commit)

///// Need To Understand ///
HEAD -> master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.



SEETING UP THE GIT REPO IN GITHUB AND GIVING ACCES RIGHT TO OUR PC

git remote add origin git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git //it means,
// git remote add kardo ,ek URL ko(git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git) , jiska naam 'origin' rakh raha hu.
// this is the URL name or the website name , which we saying it as origin(we could give any name , but its a global practice to keep the name as
// 'orgin')
// we are keeping the name to URL git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git as orgin, basicaly this is our git repository , which is 
// hosted remotely to 'github', GitTutorialDemo.git this is our repository name, we have kept the name as 'origin' and humne
// isko as a remote add kardiya.

so when we do git remote, we will get origin

git remote
    orign

git remote -v   
    origin git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git (push) 

// Dont have permsion to push to 'CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git' respository.
git push -u origin master
    ERROR: Permision to CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git denied to haris989
    fatal: could not read from remote repository

    please make sure you have correct access rights and the repository exists.

How to get permission.
settings -> SSH and GPG keys ->  New SSH key -> Title(Harry personal computer(it could be any name , my personal PC name))
google SSH key github->steps
//https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "rajkesh007@gmail.com"
    y, and enter->enter

    // ensure this is running
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        Agent pid someNumber
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa  // ssh private key ko hum aapne ssh-agent mein add karege, we will add , the ssh private key in ssh-agent.

    tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        copy the output ,which is a key and paste to settings -> SSH and GPG keys ->  New SSH key -> key(paste here)->click on Add SSH Key

git push -u origin master
    // now we will able to push our changes to remote repo in github, as i got the access. 




//ALIAS IN GIT(WE DO WHEN WE OFTEN RUN SOME COMMOND OR SOME BIG LINE CODE :P)

ALIAS means write small command which works for the big command.
like wrting git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git again and again , we will understand it as origin(alias for git@github.com:CodewithHarry/GitTutorialDemo.git)

like i am wrting 'git status', i want to write 'git st' , which willbe understood by git as git status , who shall i achieve this?

git config --global alias.st status // i told to git , that , when ever i write , 'git st' , it should understand as 'git status'
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.unstage 'restore --staged --'
git config --global alias.last 'log -p -1' // git last , is understood as git log -p -1 (last commit will be displayed)

git st (':)') same understood as git status
git ci (':)') same understood as git commit
git unstage fileName // it will unstage , and will come to working directory. this command is same as 'git restore --staged -- fileName', restore --staged -- replace to 'unstage'
